## 6. Visual indication of custom HUF final price

If a booking has a **custom agreed final price in HUF**:

- This must be **clearly and consistently indicated** in all booking-related views

Required locations:
- Booking list (table view)
- Booking expanded row / details view
- Edit booking modal
- Calendar hover / tooltip (if final price is shown there)

Visual requirements:
- The EUR final price remains the primary price
- The HUF price appears as a **secondary value**
- Clearly label it as:
  - “Custom agreement (HUF)”
- Use a visual indicator such as:
  - badge
  - icon
  - subtle highlight
- It must be immediately obvious that:
  - this is **not a converted value**
  - this is an **explicit custom agreement**

The same booking must never appear ambiguous regarding which price is official and which is custom.
